As United Nations officials pleaded for inspection and demilitarization of a battle-scarred nuclear power plant caught in Russia’s war on Ukraine, the two countries traded harsh accusations at a Security Council meeting and a path forward to avert a nuclear disaster remained unclear.

Fighting near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, has stoked alarm in recent days, amid fears that the transformation of the plant into a theater of war could lead to the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident.

The Security Council held an emergency meeting on Tuesday at the request of Russia to discuss the situation around the plant. And despite contradictory narratives about responsibility for the escalating threat — Russia and Ukraine each blame the other — the council was unanimous in its alarm about the risks to the plant and calls for an end to the fighting.

Rosemary DiCarlo, the U.N.’s top chief for political and peace building affairs, addressed the council and urged Russia and Ukraine to provide secure and immediate access to inspectors from the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or I.A.E.A.

“Agreement is urgently needed to reestablish Zaporizhzhia as purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Ms.DiCarlo said. “We must be clear that any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia, or any other nuclear facilities in Ukraine, leading to a possible nuclear incident would have catastrophic consequences, not only for the immediate vicinity, but for the region and beyond.”

“To paraphrase the Secretary General’s blunt warning, any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicidal,” she added.

The Russian military took control of the site in March but Ukrainian technicians still operate the facility. Fighting has continued near the plant including recent shelling that fell dangerously close to the reactors.

The Russian ambassador, Vassily Nebenzya, described a series of artillery and drone attacks on the plant that he claimed had been carried out by Ukrainian forces, noting that some of them had involved American-made weapons, accusations that Ukraine has called ridiculous.

Mr. Nebenzya held up a photo he said showed destruction at the plant. He said western diplomats were in a “parallel reality” when accusing Russia of attacking a nuclear plant its own military was protecting.

He said Russia would support an I.A.E.A. inspection of the nuclear plant and that Russia expected the mission would take place in the near future so “the experts can confirm the real situation.”

The deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Richard M. Mills, said people are terrified of living near the plant and blamed Russia for pushing the world to the “brink of nuclear disaster.”

“Russia created this risk and only Russia can defuse it,” he said, calling on Moscow to heed the call by the U.N.  to withdraw its troops and create a demilitarized zone around the plant. He added, “Why on earth is a nuclear facility being used as a staging ground for war?”
