On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises announced that it will acquire a 29.18% stake in the NDTV group through a subsidiary company.

Led by billionaire Gautam Adani, who is believed to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Adani Group also said it will launch an open offer to buy another 26% of NDTV’s shares. This would effectively give it majority control over one of India’s best-known news brands and among the very few that continue to be critical of the Modi government.

The announcement came as a surprise to the founders of NDTV, veteran journalists Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy, a statement by the media group said.

But the seeds for the takeover had been laid almost a decade and a half ago – by Reliance Industries Limited, the conglomerate owned by Mukesh Ambani, who used to be Asia’s richest man until Adani overtook him earlier this year.

The Reliance connection
On Tuesday, AMG Media Networks Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, bought 100% of the equity stakes in Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited for Rs 113.74 crore. It is through this company that Adani Enterprises is acquiring NDTV shares.

Incorporated in 2008, Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited describes itself as a management and consultancy services company but owns no assets.

In 2009, it had offered an unsecured loan of Rs 403.85 crore to Radhika Roy Prannoy Roy Private Limited, an entity that held a 29% share of NDTV.

Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited, for its part, had got the money from another company called Shinano Retail Private Limited in the form of another unsecured loan the same financial year.

Shinano, for its part, had got the money – also in the form of an unsecured loan – from Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited, part of the Reliance Group. In fact, Shinao, at the time, was a fully owned subsidiary of Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited.

Records of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs show that when the transactions took place, all these companies were closely linked. Vishvapradhan was owned by Shinano (with which it shared a common address) and another company called Teesta Retail Private Limited, also wholly owned by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited.

Vishvapradhan’s directors, at the time, were also senior executives at Reliance Industries Limited.

In 2012, though, Vishvapradhan’s ownership changed, statutory statements filed by the company with the corporate affairs ministry show. The new owners were Nextwave Televenture Private Limited and Skyblue Buildwell Private Limited – companies linked to Mahendra Nahata, a director at Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited.

This coincided with Eminent Networks Private Limited, of which Nahata is the owner, taking ownership of the loan Vishvapradhan owed to Shinano by investing Rs 50 crore in the firm.

Vishvapradhan, in turn, transferred the Rs 50 crore to Shinano, which claimed in its corporate filings that the former had returned the loan. However, it is not clear how that happened since Vishvapradhan had returned only Rs 50 crore of the Rs 400 crore loan.

Statements filed by Vishvapradhan with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs this year show that it was owned entirely by Nextwave Televenture – until the Adani group took it over Tuesday.

The records also suggest NDTV never returned the loan it took from Vishvapradhan. Not that it would have mattered. The terms of the loan agreement were such that Vishvapradhan, as Caravan reported in 2015, could convert it into 99.9% of the shares in Radhika Roy Prannoy Roy Private Limited “at any time during the tenure of the loan or thereafter without requiring any further act or deed on the part of the lender”.

This is what happened on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday batted for research and innovation, saying it has to be made a "way of living" with increasing acceptance for it in the society. Addressing students at the grand finale of the Smart India Hackathon, he said social and institutional support will boost innovation and new ideas and original thinking should be respected.
"Research and innovation must be transformed from the way of working to the way of living. To increase the culture of innovation in India, we have to pay constant attention to two things - social support and institutional support. The acceptance of innovation as a profession has increased in the society and in such a situation, we have to accept new ideas and original thinking," he said.
"The future of India will be dependent on innovations and work done by the youth. Your innovative mindset will take India to the top. The aspirational society of India will act as a driving force for a new India. With new ideas, new aspirations and new resolves we will move forward," Modi said.
The prime minister said India is making rapid strides by keeping its faith in the young population and noted the country's innovation index ranking has gone up. In the new National Education Policy, there is a roadmap for creating a strong foundation for innovation, he said.
"The number of patents in the last eight years has gone up by seven times and the count of unicorns has gone beyond 100. The country is progressing rapidly through one revolution after another. The infrastructure revolution and the health sector revolution is happening in India today.
"Digital revolution, technology revolution, talent revolution is happening in India today. Today, the focus is on making every sector modern," he said. The prime minister said every day new areas and challenges are seeking innovative solutions. He told the innovators to find solutions for agriculture-related issues.
"From agriculture to drones, the youth can work on innovations across sectors. I urge the youth to look at innovations not just for India but for countries around the world. We need to take affordable, sustainable and innovative solutions to the world.
"Indian innovations always provide the most competitive, affordable, sustainable, secured and at-scale solutions. That is why the world is looking towards India with hope," he said. Modi asked the young innovators to take full advantage of the initiatives like optical fibre in every village and the launch of 5G, preparation for 6G by the decade end and promotion of the gaming ecosystem.
Smart India Hackathon (SIH) has become an excellent example of public participation and the young innovators are the flag-bearers of the "Jai Anusandhan" call made by him on Independence Day, the prime minister said.
"Today's young generations are coming forward with fast and smart solutions to problems. The thinking behind such hackathons is that the young generation should provide the solutions to the problems and this collaborative spirit between the youth, government and the private organisations is a great example of �Sabka Prayas'," he said.
SIH, which started in 2017, is a nationwide initiative to provide students with a platform to solve the pressing problems of society, organisations, and government. It aims to inculcate the culture of product innovation, problem-solving and out-of-the-box thinking among students.
More than 15,000 students and mentors are travelling to the 75 nodal centres to take part in the SIH 2022 grand finale. Students from over 2,900 schools and 2,200 higher educational institutions are tackling 476 problem statements from across 53 Union ministries in the finale.
These include optical character recognition of temple inscriptions and translations in Devanagari scripts, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled risk monitoring system in the cold supply chain for perishable food items, high-resolution 3D model of terrain, and infrastructure and roads conditions in disaster-stricken areas.
Every year, Smart India Hackathon has two editions -- SIH Software and SIH Hardware. This year Smart India Hackathon-Junior has also been introduced for school students to build a culture of innovation and problem-solving attitude at the school level.
Smart India Hackathon hardware grand finale is scheduled from August 25 to 29 and the software grand finale is scheduled from August 25 to 26.
The winners in the Smart India Hackathon on each problem statement will be awarded a prize amount of Rs 1 lakh. Under the student innovation category, three prizes of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 75,000 and Rs 50,000 will be awarded to the winning teams.

Another group of US lawmakers will arrive in Taiwan on Thursday evening, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported, the third such visit this month and defying pressure from Beijing for these trips not to take place.
China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory against the strong objections of the democratically-elected government in Taipei, launched military drills near the island after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came in early August.

The Central News Agency did not name the lawmakers who were coming on Thursday, saying only that they would arrive on a US military aircraft at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport and would meet Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday.

Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that "important guests" would arrive after 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) at Songshan airport. It gave no details and declined to comment further.

The de facto US embassy in Taipei declined to comment.

Pelosi's visit infuriated China, which responded with test launches of ballistic missiles over Taipei for the first time, and by ditching some lines of dialogue with Washington, including theatre military talks and on climate change.

She was followed around a week later by five other US lawmakers, with China's military responding by carrying out more exercises near Taiwan.

The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

China has never ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control.

Taiwan's government says the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island and so has no right to claim it, and that only its 23 million people can decide their future.
