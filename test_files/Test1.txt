Ever since I saw a programme on ‘Heritage Toy Train of Darjeeling’ I was seized with a wish to enjoy a ride on it. I saved money for the trip. One day I was on the train to Jalpaiguri from Delhi.

From Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling it is 82 Isms on the toy train. The very sight of the Toy Train excited me and my eyes sparkled. Finally, I was in the dream toy. The experience indeed was off unforgettable as the train chugged through lush green and thick Terai forests. The scenes all around me were just out a fairy tale book. There were fascinating hills, waterfalls and woolly clouds almost touching the ground. The mist-filled valleys and hills lent a dreamy touch to the journey. The tall trees of oak, pine and fir stood majestically adding beauty to the scene. At most of the places the train ran alongside the motor road. The huge terraced tea plantations all along the track presented a thrilling picture that wetted the eyes. It was a really journey through a dreamland. The entire train journey took six ours but the time flew as fast as it does in a dream, years and days compressed into a few seconds-minutes.

The Toy Train passed through by tiny villages or clusters of houses or buildings on both sides. The coaches ran so close to the shops that one could pick up goods from them or talk to the shopkeepers in low voices. The school children ran along the toy coaches and giggled at the passengers. The train slowly climbed up the mountains. The people got on or off the running train with ridiculous ease and safety. All along with the track innocent and happy faces of mountain people smiled at tie passengers the women folk wore colorful woolen garments which made them look like mountain fairies. To ascend the mountain heights the Toy Train ran on a zig-zag track. I felt sorry when someone to me that the next was the terminal station of Darjeeling. How I wished more of the toy Train!
